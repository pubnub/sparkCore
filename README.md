PubNub Spark Core Library
=========================

This library allows your Spark apps to communicate with the PubNub cloud
message passing system - your apps can receive and send messages.

This is currently just a snapshot of a work in progress. It does not
compile yet, but the PubNub.* code and the PubNubDemo example are
transitioning in that direction.

The Spark Core development environment is, as of January 2014, unsuitable
for usage of complex third-party libraries. We are now holding back our
port to give the awesome Spark.io guys a bit more time to enhance the
versatility of their environment.
